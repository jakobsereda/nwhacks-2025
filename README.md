# Out&About

## Inspiration
Loneliness is a rising trend in modern life. While it is common, the effects of loneliness reach beyond your mood. Research finds that loneliness and social isolation can even lower your life expectancy. The groups often most affected are the elders in our communities. This resonates deeply with our group as we have loved ones who deal with these struggles. We wanted to create a tool to help the vulnerable members of our society find connection and belonging in their community.

## What It Does
Out&About connects you to local events near you—ranging from card games to beach walks—helping you meet new people! The app was intentionally designed with an intuitive user interface to provide a simple and straightforward experience for senior citizens.

## How We Built It
During the ideation phase, we contemplated challenges we have witnessed firsthand. We eventually landed on the idea of addressing loneliness among senior citizens. Our goal was to create an app that helps them find community while being easy to understand and use.

We used a Miro board to plan out how our project would work and who it was for. Once we started building, we divided the work into frontend and backend, with two team members assigned to each subteam. We emphasized the importance of planning before building, as aligning our vision early on saved us from many future troubles.

- **Backend**: We spent most of Saturday configuring our database (PostgreSQL), Docker, and writing a simple API to communicate with the database using Flask.
- **Frontend**: On Saturday, we created Figma designs for all the pages in the web app and began working on the TypeScript implementation and styling. 
- **Integration**: On Sunday morning, we reconvened to connect our services and finalize the frontend styling.

## Challenges We Ran Into
As is typical in hackathons, we had to quickly learn new technologies. This included Python and Flask for the backend, and TypeScript and Leaflet for the map on the frontend.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of
- We successfully created a (mostly) functional full-stack product within the hackathon time frame.
- For the majority of our team, the technologies we used were completely new, so getting everything working was a major achievement.
- We are especially proud of creating a technology aimed at making a positive impact in our local communities, particularly for one of the most important groups in our neighborhoods: the elderly.

## What We Learned
This project taught us:
- Effective methods for generating and refining concepts.
- Key principles of full-stack web development.
- Backend development, including using PostgreSQL to create database tables and Flask to create API endpoints for communication between the frontend and backend.
- Frontend development, including using Figma for design and implementing those designs with React and CSS in an organized manner.
- The usefulness of Git for sharing code and reverting to previous versions.
- How Docker allows for containerizing projects so they can run on different systems.

## What's Next for Out&About
Due to the constraints of the hackathon, we were unable to complete every feature we envisioned. Moving forward, we would prioritize:
- Enhancing cybersecurity to protect user information and locations.
